## Project Description
Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## Google Sheet
Include link to your google sheet here.  Here is the sample [Suresh had used in class]() 

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evaluate game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Feature | H | 1hr | 1.5hr | -hr|
| Feature  | H | 3hr | -hr | -hr|
| Feature | H | H | -hr | -hr|
| Feature  | H | 1.5hr| -hr | -hr |
| Feature| M | 4hr | 2hr | -hr|
| Feature | H | 3hrs| 2hr | -hr |
| Total | H | 3hrs| 2hr | -hr |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
